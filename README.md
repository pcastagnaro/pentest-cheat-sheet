  * [Leviathan](https://overthewire.org/wargames/leviathan/): This wargame doesn't require any knowledge about programming - just a bit of common sense and some knowledge about basic \*nix commands
  *   [Narnia](https://overthewire.org/wargames/narnia/): This wargame is for the ones that want to learn basic exploitation. You can see the most

      common bugs in this game and we've tried to make them easy to exploit. You'll get the

      source code of each level to make it easier for you to spot the vuln and abuse it. The

      difficulty of the game is somewhere between Leviathan and Behemoth, but some of the

      levels could be quite tricky.
  *   [Behemoth](https://overthewire.org/wargames/behemoth/): This wargame deals with a lot of regular vulnerabilities found commonly 'out&#x20;

      in the wild'. While the game makes no attempts at emulating a real environment

      it will teach you how to exploit several of the most common coding mistakes&#x20;

      including buffer overflows, race conditions and privilege escalation.
