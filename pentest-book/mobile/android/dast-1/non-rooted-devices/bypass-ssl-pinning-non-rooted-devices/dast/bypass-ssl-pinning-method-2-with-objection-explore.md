# Bypass SSL Pinning - Method 2: With Objection Explore

After the objection-altered APK ([how to patch an APK with Objection](https://app.gitbook.com/@pcastagnaro/s/pentest-cheat-sheet/pentest-book/mobile/android/dast-1/dast#patching-apk)) has been installed on our target device, running the app should result in a pause at the application startup screen. At this point, we can connect to a Frida server that should be listening on the device. If you prefer using the Frida utilities:

```
<OPEN THE APP>
$ objection explore
[usb] # android hooking search classes TrustManager
[usb] # android sslpinning disable
```
