# Subdomains Discovery

## amass

**Repository:** [https://github.com/OWASP/Amass](https://github.com/OWASP/Amass)

### **Info**

In-Depth DNS Enumeration and Network Mapping. The OWASP Amass tool suite obtains subdomain names by scraping data sources, recursive brute forcing, crawling web archives, permuting/altering names and reverse DNS sweeping. Additionally, Amass uses the IP addresses obtained during resolution to discover associated netblocks and ASNs. All the information is then used to build maps of the target networks.

### **Installation**

{% tabs %}

### Parameth

**Repo:** [https://github.com/maK-/parameth](https://github.com/maK-/parameth)

**Info:** This tool can be used to brute discover GET and POST parameters

Often when you are busting a directory for common files, you can identify scripts (for example test.php) that look like they need to be passed an unknown parameter. This hopefully can help find them.

The -off flag allows you to specify an offset (helps with dynamic pages) so for example, if you were getting alternating response sizes of 4444 and 4448, set the offset to 5 and it will only show the stuff outside the norm

### HostileSubBruteforcer

**Repo:** [https://github.com/nahamsec/HostileSubBruteforcer](https://github.com/nahamsec/HostileSubBruteforcer)

**Info:** This app will bruteforce for exisiting subdomains and provide the following information:

* IP address
* Host

if the 3rd party host has been properly setup. (for example if site.example.com is poiting to a nonexisiting Heroku subdomain, it'll alert you) -> Currently only works with AWS, Github, Heroku, shopify, tumblr and squarespace.

There may be some false positives depending on the host configurations. (Tried to take them out as much as possible) Also works recursively at the end to get the subdomains under the ones that it has already found and dumps all your data into an output.txt file just in case (fresh one gets created at the beginning of each process)

More info [http://labs.detectify.com/post/109964122636/hostile-subdomain-takeover-using](http://labs.detectify.com/post/109964122636/hostile-subdomain-takeover-using)

### tko-subs

**Repo:** [https://github.com/anshumanbh/tko-subs](https://github.com/anshumanbh/tko-subs)

* To check whether a subdomain has a dangling CNAME pointing to a CMS provider (Heroku, Github, Shopify, Amazon S3, Amazon CloudFront, etc.) that can be taken over.
* To actually take over those subdomain by providing a flag -takeover. Currently, take over is only supported for Github Pages and Heroku Apps and by default the take over functionality is off.
* To specify your own CMS providers and check for them via the providers-data.csv file. In that file, you would mention the CMS name, their CNAME value, their string that you want to look for and whether it only works over HTTP or not. Check it out for some examples.

### Recon-ng

**Repo:** [https://bitbucket.org/LaNMaSteR53/recon-ng](https://bitbucket.org/LaNMaSteR53/recon-ng)

**Info:** econ-ng is a full-featured Web Reconnaissance framework written in Python. Complete with independent modules, database interaction, built in convenience functions, interactive help, and command completion, Recon-ng provides a powerful environment in which open source web-based reconnaissance can be conducted quickly and thoroughly.

Recon-ng has a look and feel similar to the Metasploit Framework, reducing the learning curve for leveraging the framework. However, it is quite different. Recon-ng is not intended to compete with existing frameworks, as it is designed exclusively for web-based open source reconnaissance. If you want to exploit, use the Metasploit Framework. If you want to social engineer, use the Social-Engineer Toolkit. If you want to conduct reconnaissance, use Recon-ng! See the Usage Guide for more information.

Recon-ng is a completely modular framework and makes it easy for even the newest of Python developers to contribute. Each module is a subclass of the "module" class. The "module" class is a customized "cmd" interpreter equipped with built-in functionality that provides simple interfaces to common tasks such as standardizing output, interacting with the database, making web requests, and managing API keys. Therefore, all the hard work has been done. Building modules is simple and takes little more than a few minutes. See the Development Guide for more information.

### enumall.py

**Repo:** [https://github.com/jhaddix/domain](https://github.com/jhaddix/domain)

**Info:** Script to enumerate subdomains, leveraging recon-ng. Uses google scraping, bing scraping, baidu scraping, yahoo scarping, netcraft, and bruteforces to find subdomains. Plus resolves to IP.

### Altdns - Subdomain discovery through alterations and permutations

**Repo:** [https://github.com/infosec-au/altdns](https://github.com/infosec-au/altdns)

**Info:** Altdns is a DNS recon tool that allows for the discovery of subdomains that conform to patterns. Altdns takes in words that could be present in subdomains under a domain (such as test, dev, staging) as well as takes in a list of subdomains that you know of.

From these two lists that are provided as input to altdns, the tool then generates a massive output of "altered" or "mutated" potential subdomains that could be present. It saves this output so that it can then be used by your favourite DNS bruteforcing tool.

Alternatively, the -r flag can be passed to altdns so that once this output is generated, the tool can then resolve these subdomains (multi-threaded) and save the results to a file.

Altdns works best with large datasets. Having an initial dataset of 200 or more subdomains should churn out some valid subdomains via the alterations generated.

### RobotsDisallowed

**Repo:** [https://github.com/danielmiessler/RobotsDisallowed](https://github.com/danielmiessler/RobotsDisallowed)

**Info:** The RobotsDisallowed project is a harvest of the Disallowed directories from the robots.txt files of the world's top websites--specifically the Alexa 100K.
