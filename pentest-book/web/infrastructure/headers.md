# Headers

### Security headers

**Repo:** [https://securityheaders.com/](https://securityheaders.com/)

**Info:** I built Security Headers after deploying security headers like CSP and HSTS to my own site. I wanted a quick and easy way to check if other sites were using these headers and I figured I'd turn it into a useful tool for everyone to use!

{% code overflow="wrap" lineNumbers="true" fullWidth="true" %}
```bash
https://securityheaders.com/?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.domain.com%2F&followRedirects=on
```
{% endcode %}
