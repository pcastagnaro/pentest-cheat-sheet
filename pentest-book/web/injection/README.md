## XSSHunter

**Repo:** [https://github.com/mandatoryprogrammer/xsshunter](https://github.com/mandatoryprogrammer/xsshunter)

**Info:** This is a portable version of the source code running on https://xsshunter.com. It is designed to be easily-installable on any server for security professionals and bug bounty hunters who wish to test for XSS in a much more powerful way.

If you don't want to set up this software and would rather just start testing, see [https://xsshunter.com](https://xsshunter.com/).

## XSStrike

**Repository:** [https://github.com/s0md3v/XSStrike/](https://github.com/s0md3v/XSStrike/wiki/Usage)

**Usage:** [https://github.com/s0md3v/XSStrike/wiki/Usage](https://github.com/s0md3v/XSStrike/wiki/Usage)

### Scan a single URL <a href="#user-content-scan-a-single-url" id="user-content-scan-a-single-url"></a>

Option: `-u` or `--url`

Test a single webpage which uses GET method.

{% code overflow="wrap" lineNumbers="true" %}
```bash
python xsstrike.py -u "http://example.com/search.php?q=query"
```
{% endcode %}

### **Supplying POST data**

{% code overflow="wrap" lineNumbers="true" %}
```bash
python xsstrike.py -u "http://example.com/search.php" --data "q=query"
```
{% endcode %}

### Testing URL path components <a href="#user-content-testing-url-path-components" id="user-content-testing-url-path-components"></a>

Option: `--path`

Want to inject payloads in the URL path like `http://example.com/search/<payload>`, you can do that with `--path` switch.

{% code overflow="wrap" lineNumbers="true" %}
```bash
python xsstrike.py -u "http://example.com/search/form/query" --path
```
{% endcode %}

### Treat POST data as JSON <a href="#user-content-treat-post-data-as-json" id="user-content-treat-post-data-as-json"></a>

Option: `--json`

This switch can be used to test JSON data via POST method.

{% code overflow="wrap" lineNumbers="true" %}
```bash
python xsstrike.py -u "http://example.com/search.php" --data '{"q":"query"}' --json
```
{% endcode %}

### Using Proxies

Option: `--proxy` (Default `0.0.0.0:8080`)

You have to set up your prox(y|ies) in `core/config.py` and then you can use the `--proxy` switch to use them whenever you want. More information on setting up proxies can be found here.

{% code overflow="wrap" lineNumbers="true" fullWidth="true" %}
```bash
python xsstrike.py -u "http://example.com/search.php?q=query" --proxy
```
{% endcode %}

## tplmap

**Repo:** [https://github.com/epinna/tplmap](https://github.com/epinna/tplmap)

**Info:** Tplmap assists the exploitation of Code Injection and Server-Side Template Injection vulnerabilities with a number of sandbox escape techniques to get access to the underlying operating system.

The tool and its test suite are developed to research the SSTI vulnerability class and to be used as offensive security tool during web application penetration tests.

The sandbox break-out techniques came from James Kett's Server-Side Template Injection: RCE For The Modern Web App, other public researches \[1] \[2], and original contributions to this tool \[3] \[4].

It fully compromises the server exploiting several code context and blind injection scenarios. It also supports eval()-like code injections in Python, Ruby, PHP, Java and generic unsandboxed template engines.

## Sleepy Puppy

**Repo:** [https://github.com/Netflix/sleepy-puppy](https://github.com/Netflix/sleepy-puppy)

**Info:** Sleepy Puppy is a cross-site scripting (XSS) payload management framework which simplifies the ability to capture, manage, and track XSS propagation over long periods of time.

## Commix

**Repo:** [https://github.com/commixproject/commix](https://github.com/commixproject/commix)

**Info:** Commix (short for \[comm]and \[i]njection e\[x]ploiter) is an automated tool written by Anastasios Stasinopoulos (@ancst) that can be used from web developers, penetration testers or even security researchers in order to test web-based applications with the view to find bugs, errors or vulnerabilities related to command injection attacks. By using this tool, it is very easy to find and exploit a command injection vulnerability in a certain vulnerable parameter or HTTP header.

## XSS Radar

**Repo:** [https://github.com/bugbountyforum/XSS-Radar](https://github.com/bugbountyforum/XSS-Radar)

**Info:** XSS Radar is a tool that detects parameters and fuzzes them for cross-site scripting vulnerabilities.
