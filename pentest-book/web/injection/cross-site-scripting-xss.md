# Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

## XSSER

```
xsser --auto=<URL> --cookie=<COOKIE>
```

## WFUZZ

Wfuzz is another popular tool used to fuzz applications not only for XSS vulnerabilities, but also SQL injections, hidden directories, form parameters, and more. It is included in Kali by default.

Basic usage of Wfuzz includes specifying a wordlist file including the payloads to use with the **-z** flag, and the URL to test, replacing the parameter in question with **FUZZ**. We can also set the **-c** flag to get color output.

```
wfuzz -c -z file,/usr/share/wfuzz/wordlist/Injections/XSS.txt http://domain.com/application/index.php?page=FUZZ
```

Also of use, when fuzzing an application where many different response codes might be encountered, the **--hc** flag can be utilized to ignore certain responses, such as 404 codes.

Another helpful feature of Wfuzz is the ability to encode payloads in order to bypass defensive filters more effectively.

Simply append the desired encoder (in this case urlencode) to the specified file, separated by a comma, to encode the payloads.

```
wfuzz -c -z file,/usr/share/wfuzz/wordlist/Injections/XSS.txt,urlencode http://domain.com/application/index.php?page=FUZZ
```

## XSStrike

It is a dedicated suite for detecting cross-site scripting vulnerabilities that includes an intelligent payload generator, a fuzzer, a crawler, WAF detection, and more. XSStrike is currently in beta.

{% code overflow="wrap" lineNumbers="true" fullWidth="true" %}
```bash
git clone https://github.com/s0md3v/XSStrike

cd XSStrike
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
{% endcode %}

This tool begins by checking for DOM-based XSS vulnerabilities, and the potentially vulnerable parameters are displayed on the screen. Reflected XSS is tested for next, and the interactive payload generator displays the payload and the projected likelihood of success. To continue scanning, hit **y** at the prompt.

### Scan a single URL

Option: `-u` or `--url`. Test a single webpage which uses GET method.

{% code overflow="wrap" lineNumbers="true" fullWidth="true" %}
```bash
python xsstrike.py -u "http://example.com/search.php?q=query"
```
{% endcode %}

### Supplying POST data python

{% code overflow="wrap" lineNumbers="true" fullWidth="true" %}
```bash
xsstrike.py -u "http://example.com/search.php" --data "q=query"
```
{% endcode %}

### Supply HTTP headers

Option: `--headers`. This option will open your text editor (default is 'nano') and you can simply paste your HTTP headers and press `Ctrl + S` to save.

If your operating system doesn't support this or you don't want to do this anyway, you can simply add headers from command line separated by  as follows:

{% code overflow="wrap" lineNumbers="true" fullWidth="false" %}
```bash
python xsstrike.py -u "http://example.com/page.php?q=query" --headers "Accept-Language: en-US\nCookie: null" --file-log-level DEBUG --log-file output.log
```
{% endcode %}
