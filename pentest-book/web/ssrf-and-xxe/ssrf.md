## [ground-control](https://github.com/jobertabma/ground-control)

This is a collection of most of my scripts that I use to debug Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF), blind XSS, and insecure XXE processing vulnerabilities. This is still a work in progress, as I'm still collecting all the scripts that I have lingering around. Before using these scripts, I used to rewrite these scripts most of the time or set up listeners with `netcat`. That wasn't scalable, so I started collecting the scripts in a repository, which can be closed easily every time it's needed it on a server.
